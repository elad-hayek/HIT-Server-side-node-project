COLLABORATIVE TOOLS SUMMARY & DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
================================================================================

GitHub was used as the main collaborative development tool, allowing team members to work in parallel on separate features using branches,
manage version control, and safely merge changes through pull requests.
This enabled efficient coordination and prevented code conflicts.
Slack was used as the primary communication tool for the team,
supporting real-time discussions, task coordination, and quick problem solving. 
Through Slack, we shared updates, divided responsibilities, and kept continuous communication throughout the project,
which helped us work as a coordinated and organized team.
